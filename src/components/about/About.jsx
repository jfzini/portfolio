          Hello, my name is Jo√£o Felipe Zini Hespanhol, and I'm passionate about technology.
          I've always had an affinity for the field, but I grew up in a conservative environment
          that limited my career options. As a result, I was directed to study Law,
          just like my father.
          </p>
          <p>
          My academic journey in law was marked by excellence, allowing me to solve unexplored
          problems and explore new areas. However, even though I achieved financial stability,
          Law didn't provide me with a sense of professional fulfillment.
          </p>
          <p>
          To change this, I planned a transition to my true passion: software development.
          I acquired technical skills in various technologies, both in Front-end and Back-end,
          and I'm eager to embark on this new journey with enthusiasm and dedication.
          </p>
